# Opscode Omnibus #
Build instructions for (ruby) omnibus to build private chef within a VirtualBox
virtual machine.

# Prerequisites

## VirtualBox

Ensure you have downloaded and installed VirtualBox 4.1.6 from the [project website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

# Initial Configuration

Ensure all required gems are installed and ready to use:

    bundle install

# Build It!

To initiate an omnibus build on Ubuntu 10.04

```
vagrant omnibus build ubuntu-10.04 private-chef
```

# Vagrant VM Management

The build environment utilizes the multi-vm functionality of Vagrant to execute builds across multiple platforms. For a quick primer on how to use Vagrant in a multi-vm setup see [the documentation](http://vagrantup.com/docs/multivm.html).

## Tips and Tricks

The following are some useful tips and tricks for using Vagrant in a multi-vm setup.

### Status

`vagrant status` will print the status of each VM in your environment:

```
> vagrant status
Current VM states:

ubuntu-10.04             not created
centos-6.0               running

This environment represents multiple VMs. The VMs are all listed
above with their current state. For more information about a specific
VM, run `vagrant status NAME`.
```

### Up

`vagrant up` will create and provision all of the virtual build machines in your environment. In most cases, you will want to specify which type of VM you would like to build. To create an Ubuntu 10.04 VM, simply execute `vagrant up ubuntu-10.04`.

### SSH

`vagrant ssh` will log you in to the VM of your choice. To log in to your Ubuntu VM, execute `vagrant ssh ubuntu-10.04`.
