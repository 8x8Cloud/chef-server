This file lists how the chef-server project is maintained. When making changes to the system, this file tells you who needs to review your patch - you need a simple majority of maintainers for the relevant subsystems to provide a :+1: on your pull request. Additionally, you need to not receive a veto from a Lieutenant or the Project Lead.
