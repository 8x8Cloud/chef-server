This is the Erlang implementation of Chef's REST API.

Currently implemented endpoints are:

* Search: /organizations/<org_id>/search/<obj_type>

Note: Parameters are enclosed in angle brackets

Building erchef (tl;dr version)
---------------------------------
1) Install Erlang R14B03 or later

2) Run 'make rel'

3) 'cd rel/erchef;bin/erchef start'

4) Profit!

Building erchef (longer version)
----------------------------------
1) Install Erlang R14B03 or later

2) (Optional) Build dialyzer PLT which includes erts, kernel, stdlib, crypto,
   and public_key. If you've never done this before, use the command below:

   dialyzer --build_plt --apps erts kernel stdlib crypto public_key

3) Run 'make'. This will download all dependencies and compile all code.

4) Run 'make test'. This will execute the test suites for chef_rest and
   chef_common. All tests should pass.

5) (Optional) If you've got an up to date PLT file (see #2) you can use
   dialyzer to perform static analysis on erchef. Running 'make dialyzer'
   will perform analysis against chef_rest and chef_common.

6) erchef is designed to be deployed as a standalone OTP release. You can
   build a release via either 'make rel' or 'make devrel'. The devrel target
   is highly recommended for developers working on erchef directly. This
   target symlinks all dependencies and application so the release doesn't
   have to be rebuilt each time code is changed.

   If a release has been built via 'make devrel' you can rebuild and load
   changed code into the running erchef instance via 'make update'.
   NOTE: This performs a warm reboot of the Erlang VM so any application
   state will be totally lost.

7) You can start the erchef release with an interactive shell via the
   command below:

   cd rel/erchef;bin/erchef console

Deploying to rs-preprod
-----------------------

    knife ec2 server create -G rs-preprod,platform-server \
        --flavor m1.small -I ami-9a9c6bf3 \
        -x ubuntu -r 'role[opscode-erchef],role[rs-preprod]' \
        -i ~/.ssh/opscode-preprod-20101208
